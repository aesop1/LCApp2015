Hi Matt,

Here are the changes we spoke about this morning.


HOME
• Try to center the word “Conference” all other icons and words are then justified right using the C in conference as the left side guide. See original design.
• No apostrophe in the word “Leaders"
• I will supply a new background image
• Navis logo smaller

WELCOME
• Create a style that has title (all caps) and job title to match the Welcome PSD design - this will be used for all speakers bios
• Roughly 70px right and left margin - this will be used for all speakers bios

SPEAKERS
• Jay will supply new headshot in square format to be rendered in a circle using CSS.
• Same style for name and title as Welcome page (this won't work: the name appears aligned left in the unexpanded area and must appear in the same place. I can provide the circled headshot once the photos are available).

AGENDA
• Lets try to add a left margin of about 15px. I’m not exact on this but I think it needs more space (On an iPod Touch the right hand side of the button is cut off. Let's test this on devices first)
• Jay will supply the art for the new filter in the footer
• Jay will design color circles that represent the different session tracks.
• Jay will design the session detail page

SURVEY
• Please add a left and right margin of about 70px. This margin width should match what ever we come up with for the Welcome and Speakers bio pages.

RESORT
• Please add a left and right margin of about 70px. This margin width should match what ever we come up with for the Welcome and Speakers bio pages.
• Jay will supply a new map if you need for the smaller width page


Thanks

Jay Papke
Creative Director
